ECHORAG

Chat with your data using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

ECHORAG is a Python-based chatbot powered by RAG that lets you upload and interact with your own data — such as stories, news, or documents — through a simple chat interface. Instead of relying only on the model’s pre-trained knowledge, it retrieves relevant context from your data and generates accurate, grounded responses.

With ECHORAG, static information becomes a dynamic conversational assistant, useful for building knowledge bots, exploring archives, summarizing content, or answering FAQs.

🔎 RAG-powered Retrieval – Finds the most relevant context before answering

💬 Interactive Chat – Ask natural questions in real time
